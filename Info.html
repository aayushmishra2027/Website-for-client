          <h3>Reiki theropy :</h3>
          <p>
            Reiki is a Japanese healing practice based on channeling universal
            life energy. Practitioners use their hands to transmit this energy,
            aiming to promote relaxation and healing. Reiki sessions involve
            light touch or hands held slightly above the body. It's believed to
            help reduce stress, improve well-being, and support the body's
            natural healing process. Reiki is often used alongside conventional
            medical treatments as a complementary therapy. Recipients typically
            report feelings of calm, balance, and comfort after sessions. It's
            considered non-invasive and can be beneficial for people of all ages
            and health conditions. Reiki sessions vary in length, and
            individuals remain fully clothed during the treatment. Overall,
            Reiki offers a gentle and comforting approach to holistic healing
            and well-being.

          <h3>Angel healing :</h3>
          <p>
            Angel healing is an alternative therapy involving angels for healing
            and guidance. Practitioners use meditation, visualization, and
            energy healing techniques. It aims to promote physical, emotional,
            mental, and spiritual well-being. Sessions may include angel card
            readings or Reiki combined with angelic guidance. The goal is to
            release negativity, find inner peace, and connect with divine
            guidance. While not scientifically proven, many find it spiritually
            uplifting and supportive. Angel healing is often used as a
            complementary therapy, not a substitute for medical treatment.

          <p>
            Removing black magic encompasses various techniques aimed at
            dispelling negative energies or influences. Individuals often employ
            prayers, energy healing, and visualization to cleanse themselves of
            malevolent forces. Additionally, herbal remedies believed to possess
            protective qualities are used, while seeking assistance from
            experienced spiritual practitioners remains crucial. These
            practitioners offer personalized rituals and ceremonies tailored to
            the individual's needs, ensuring a comprehensive approach to
            healing. Approaching the removal of black magic requires careful
            consideration and a balance between spiritual and practical actions.
            While spiritual methods provide empowerment and protection,
            addressing underlying vulnerabilities and seeking psychological
            support are equally important. Integrating these approaches fosters
            holistic healing, empowering individuals to overcome the effects of
            black magic and regain a sense of harmony and well-being in their
            lives.

          <p>
            Therapy for addressing bad dreams and tension typically involves a
            combination of psychological techniques and coping strategies to
            alleviate distress and promote better sleep and overall well-being.
            Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is commonly used to address
            recurring nightmares and tension. It helps individuals identify and
            challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs that contribute to
            anxiety and stress. Through CBT, individuals learn relaxation
            techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle
            relaxation, to reduce physical tension and promote relaxation before
            bedtime.
